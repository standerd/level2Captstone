# level2Capstone

This project was built using react and node js.

It fetches data from the Itunes API and diplays the data in the React Client user interface.

There is no database or authentication so once the server restarts the user favorites that is storeable will reset.

In order to use the program do the following:

To start the project, open the project file and navigate to the folder in your text editor and open up  terminal window.

in the main project folder run npm install, which will install the server and it's dependancies.

Once complete cd into the frontend folder and run npm install, this will install react and all of its dependancies.

Once the installation in completed, you need to run npm start in both the main project folder as well the the frontend folder. Running NPM start in both will start both the server localhost and also the react localhost.

React should automatically open a new tab in you default browser, if it does not, please navigate to

http://localhost:3000
