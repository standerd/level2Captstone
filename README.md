# level2Capstone

This project was built using react and node js.

It fetches data from the Itunes API and diplays the data in the React Client user interface.

There is no database or authentication so once the server restarts the user favorites that is storeable will reset.

In order to use the program do the following:

Copy to the project to your local machine.

Navigate to the foleder in the terminal. You will need 2 terminal instances as you need to run the React and Node servers.

In the main project folder run npm start and then navigate into the client folder and run npm start.

This should then have start both the React and Node server.

Starting the react server should automatically open a new window in your browser, if it does not, navigate to localhost:3000
to see the main landing client interface.
